## The Perfect Pitch

"We took BBC Ceefax - the 1980s TV information service that died in 2012 - and resurrected it as a zero-latency DevOps dashboard. It runs in your terminal, uses the authentic 8-color palette, displays real system metrics, and updates every second with a ticking clock and scrolling ticker. It's the perfect blend of nostalgia and utility, and it fits the Resurrection theme perfectly. Press F1 to see it."
