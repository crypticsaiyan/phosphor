# Sample file for wormhole demo
# This file demonstrates the peer-to-peer file transfer feature

## Configuration Example

server: production
database:
  host: db.example.com
  port: 5432
  ssl: true

api_keys:
  openai: sk-demo-key-12345
  stripe: sk_test_demo_67890

## Notes

This file would normally contain sensitive configuration.
With Cord-TUI's wormhole feature, you can transfer it
peer-to-peer without uploading to the cloud.

No Slack. No Dropbox. No traces.
Just pure encrypted magic.

Usage:
  /send demo.txt
  # Share the code with your teammate
  # They run: /grab <code>
